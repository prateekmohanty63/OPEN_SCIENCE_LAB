## Research Lab Website Design Template

This is a research lab website template that can be used by university students / professors to create a simple website for showing and displaying their labs / research. 

I built this for my brother years ago, and you can find his current site here: [University of Illinois Energy Transport Research Lab](http://etrl.mechanical.illinois.edu/)

You can find a live view of the template using the link below:
